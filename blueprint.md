# EmoVue - Application Blueprint

## Overview

EmoVue is a Next.js application designed to analyze emotions from facial expressions. It will use a combination of front-end and back-end technologies to deliver a seamless user experience.

## Project Structure

- **Framework:** Next.js with App Router
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS
- **UI Components:** Custom components for a unique look and feel.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration functionality.
- **Facial Emotion Recognition:** Real-time emotion analysis from a webcam feed.

## Current Plan

The immediate goal is to resolve the critical errors that are preventing the application from running. The plan is as follows:

1.  **Correct Project Configuration:** Fix issues in `next.config.mjs` and `tsconfig.json` to ensure the project is correctly configured for the App Router and path aliases.
2.  **Clean and Reinstall Dependencies:** Remove all existing `node_modules` and the `.next` directory to start with a clean slate, then reinstall all dependencies.
3.  **Fix Code-Level Errors:** Address the syntax errors and module resolution problems in the application's code.
4.  **Ensure Environment Stability:** Verify that the development environment is stable and that the application runs without errors.
